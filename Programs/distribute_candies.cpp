// Distribute Candies

// Shaky has N (1<=N<=50000) candy boxes each of them contains a non-zero number of candies (between 1 and 1000000000). Shaky want to distribute these candies among his K (1<=K<=1000000000) IIIT-Delhi students. He wants to distribute them in a way such that:
// 1. All students get an equal number of candies.
// 2. All the candies which a student gets must be from a single box only.
// As he wants to make all of them happy so he wants to give as many candies as possible. Help Shaky in finding out what is the maximum number of candies which a student can get.

// Input
// First-line contains T the number of test cases. 
// The first line of each test case contains N and K.
// Next line contains N space-separated integers, ith of which is the number of candies in the ith box.

// Output
// For each test case print the required answer in a separate line.
// Constraints
// 1<= T <= 10^5
// 1 <= N <= 10^5
// 1 <= K <= 10^9
// 0 <= A[i] <= 10^9
// Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^6

// Sample Input:
// 2
// 3 2 
// 3 1 4
// 4 1
// 3 2 3 9
// Sample Output:
// 3
// 9
